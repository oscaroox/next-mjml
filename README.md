# next-mjml

`next-mjml` is a Node.js package designed to enable Next.js to understand how to import MJML (markup language for responsive email) files. This plugin adds the ability to load MJML files in a similar fashion to how images are loaded, but instead of a file path, it returns a parsed HTML string. The package depends on `mjml`.

## Installation

To install `next-mjml` and its dependencies, use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install next-mjml mjml
```

or

```bash
yarn add next-mjml mjml
```

## Usage

1. Create or open your `next.config.js` file.

2. Import `next-mjml` at the beginning of the file:

```javascript
const { withMJML } = require('next-mjml');
```

3. Define any MJML options you want to customize (optional):

```javascript
const mjmlOptions = {
  // Add your MJML options here as key-value pairs
  minify: true,
  beautify: false,
  // ...
};
```

4. Use the `withMJML` function and pass in the `mjmlOptions` object as an argument:

```javascript
module.exports = withMJML(mjmlOptions)({
  // Your Next.js configuration options go here
});
```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use `next-mjml` in your Next.js project:

1. Create an MJML file named `email.mjml` in the root of your project:

```xml
<!-- email.mjml -->
<mjml>
  <mj-body>
    <mj-section>
      <mj-column>
        <mj-text>Hello World!</mj-text>
      </mj-column>
    </mj-section>
  </mj-body>
</mjml>
```

2. Import and use the MJML file:

```jsx
// pages/api/user.js
...
import mailer from "..."
import email from './email.mjml'; // Use the mjml file as a regular import
...

export default handler(req, res) {
    if (req.method === 'POST') {
        mailer.sendEmail(email, "example@example.com");
    }
    ...
}
```

## MJML Options

The `mjmlOptions` object allows you to customize the MJML compilation process according to your specific needs. You can refer to the official `mjml` documentation to explore the available options and their usage.

**Important Note**: Be cautious when using `mjmlOptions` and make sure the options are compatible with the version of `mjml` installed in your project.

## Credits

This package was inspired by the need to seamlessly integrate MJML files into Next.js projects, allowing developers to work with responsive email templates more efficiently.
